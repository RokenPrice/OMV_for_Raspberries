# OMV for Raspberries

This repository contains the changed files needed to transform a fully automated Armbian OMV image for any of the Armbian supported devices into an image suitable for Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 (or future models that rely on ARM CPU cores that can run at least ARMv7 code).

Details -- especially how to combine such a modified Armbian rootfs with the proprietary Raspberry Pi bootloader stuff -- can be found in this [OMV forum announcement thread](https://forum.openmediavault.org/index.php/Thread/18991).
